3.4:
Q：What is the frequency resolution (difference in frequency between the bins) of the FFT obtained above?
A：40Hz

3.5: 
Q：How will the frequency resolution change in this case if you zero-pad the input signal with the same of zeros as the length of the input signal?
A：The resolution will be doubled.
